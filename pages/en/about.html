        <h1>A Journey from animation to Web Development
        </h1>
        <div class = "intro-content">
            <p>I began my career as a sports monitor at <a href="https://www.aventureparc.be/en" target="_blank">Aventure Parc Waver</a>. where I welcomed, equipped, and guided visitors through treetop courses, ensuring their safety while enhancing their experience. I was also in charge of organizing and hosting birthday parties for younger children who couldn't climb. Over time, I had the opportunity to take on more responsibilities, becoming a <strong>bungee jump monitor </strong> and eventually a <strong>teambuilding manager</strong>. During off-peak seasons, we handled <strong>gardening</strong> and maintenance tasks to keep the park in top shape. One of the most demanding but rewarding projects I participated in was the <strong>implementation of a continuous lifeline system</strong>, a major safety upgrade for the park.</p>

            <p>Before transitioning to web development, I spent over 10 years in Retail, starting as a cashier at in Action Perwez. Eager for challenges, I quickly became an  <strong>assistant manager</strong>, learning the ins and outs of  <strong>team leadership, stock management, and commercial strategy</strong>. However, as my values no longer aligned with the company’s approach to people management, I moved to Hema, where I found a more fulfilling role.
            <br>
            <br>
            At Hema, I spent two years as an <strong>assistant manager</strong> for a team of 15 before being promoted to <strong>store manager</strong>. This position allowed me to develop and <strong>implement commercial strategies</strong> while maintaining a strong focus on <strong>customer service and team cohesion</strong>. My team and I navigated through <strong>challenging times, including the COVID-19 crisis and severe flooding</strong>, reinforcing my ability to adapt, lead, and <strong>think creatively</strong> under pressure.

        <h1>Passion for Board Games & Event Organization</h1>
        <div class = "intro-content">
            <p>Board games have always held a special place in my heart. After a period where work and studies took priority, I decided to realign my life with my passion. In 2022, I took the leap and combined my skills in <strong>event organization, animation, and gaming</strong> to create <a href="https://desmentiel.be/" target="_blank">Dés-mentiel</a>. This project is a perfect reflection of my strengths and passions, allowing me to bring people together through playful experiences.
            <br>
            My journey took an exciting turn when I discovered <a href="https://www.wanna-play.be/fr/" target="_blank">Wanna Play</a> and its passionate community. Enthralled by their vision, I quickly joined as a volunteer, contributing my <strong>energy and creativity</strong> to the organization of unforgettable gaming events, including the Wanna Play in Brussels 2022 festival.
            I love sharing my passion and introducing others to this amazing world—whether with family, friends, or fellow enthusiasts.
